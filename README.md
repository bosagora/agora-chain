## Abort
[Agora-el](https://github.com/bosagora/agora-el) is an execution client that has an EVM.  
Agora-el was forked from Ethereum's execution client, [ethereum/go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) version 1.10.23.  
We implemented the function of issuing commons budget in Agora-el.

[Agora-cl](https://github.com/bosagora/agora-cl) is a consensus client with a focus on usability, security, and reliability.  
Agora-cl was forked from Ethereum's consensus client, [prysmaticlabs/prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) version 3.1.1.  
We modified the block confirmation rewards in Agora-cl.

## Install Docker Engine

To run the Agora node, you must first install the Docker Engine.  
See [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for instructions on how to install the Docker Engine  
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

## For Linux or MacOS users

### Install for Linux or MacOS

- Install
  
  ```shell
  mkdir agora-chain
  cd agora-chain
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bosagora/agora-chain/v0.x.x/agora.sh)"
  ```
  
- Change to BOSagora main network

  ```shell
  ./agora.sh network mainnet
  ```

- Change to BOSagora test network

  ```shell
  ./agora.sh network testnet
  ```

- Change to BOSagora development network

  ```shell
  ./agora.sh network devnet
  ```

- Available commands and descriptions of agora.sh

  ```txt
  ./agora.sh 
  agora.sh version 2.0.0
  Usage: ./agora.sh PROCESS FLAGS.
  PROCESS can be el-node, cl-node, validator, docker-compose, docker-compose-monitoring, start, stop, upgrade
  
  ./agora.sh network <network to change>
         - <network to change> is one of mainnet, testnet, and devnet, and the default is mainnet.
         - If <network to change> is not specified, it shows the currently set up network.
  
  ./agora.sh el-node ( init, run )
      el-node init
         - Initialize agora-el. At this point, all existing block data is deleted.
      el-node run
         - Run agora-el.
  
  ./agora.sh cl-node ( run )
      cl-node run
         - Run agora-cl.
  
  ./agora.sh validator ( accounts, exit, withdraw, slashing-protection-history, wallet )
  
  ./agora.sh validator accounts ( import, list, backup )

         - Add the validator's keys to the local wallet.
      validator accounts list
         - Show the validator's keys stored in the local wallet.
      validator accounts delete
         - Delete the validator's keys from the local wallet.

         - One validator must validate only once per block. Otherwise, the validator may be slashed.
             - If a validator runs on multiple servers, that validator may violate the above condition.
             - If a validator's server is changed to another server, the validator may violate the above condition.
             - To avoid this, you need to transfer the block verification information that the validators has performed so far.
      validator slashing-protection-history import <data folder>
         - Register block verification information performed by validators.

      deposit-cli existing-mnemonic
         - This command is used to re-generate or derive new keys from your existing mnemonic.
      deposit-cli generate-bls-to-execution-change <data folder>
         - Generates the data required to register the address to which the validator's amount will be withdrawn.
