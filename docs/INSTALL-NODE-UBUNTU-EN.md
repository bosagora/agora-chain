Executing the above command will receive the previous blocks. You can see that 'age' is getting smaller and smaller in the log contents.  
If the block number in the log is the same as the most recent block number found at http://boascan.io, all historical data has been received.  
Also, if the number of imported blocks, such as the last line, is 1, then all are received.

If the slot in the log is the same as the most recent slot found on http://agorascan.io, all historical data has been received.  

## 8. Running 'agora-cl-validator'

### 8.1. To connect using a new terminal

- Access AWS `EC2 Dashboard`.
- Select the `Instance` item to go to the screen that shows the instances.
- Select the EC2 instance for which you want to connect.
- Click the button `Connect` in the upper right corner. This will switch to the `Connect to instance` screen.
- Click the button `Connect` in the lower right corner.
- It is then connected to the EC2 Instance as a terminal.

Run the command below to navigate to the installed folder.  

```shell
cd agora-chain-mainnet
```

### 8.2. Importing a validator's key

You can import multiple validation keys to a single server.  
The validator key must be generated by the user as a key generation program.  
The validator key is used when the validator program signs blocks proposed by other validators.  
The file name of the validator key is in the following format: # is any number.  

```text
keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-##########.json
```

A folder called 'root/wallet' is created when the validator key is imported. Multiple validation keys are stored here as a single file.  
You must also enter a password to access 'wallet'.  
When you import the first validator key, 'wallet' is automatically generated. Enter the password for 'wallet' at this time.  
Therefore, you should understand that the password of the validator key and the password of the wallet may exist differently.  

#### 8.2.1. Send validator key to server

There are many ways to transfer files to a server.  
Here, we'll try copying the contents of a file on my computer, and then creating and pasting the file on the server.  

Use the command below to create a folder named `mykeys` under the folder `root`.  

```shell
mkdir root/mykeys
```

Use the command below to create the file `key1.json` under the folder `root/mykeys` and run the editor.  

```shell
nano root/mykeys/key1.json
```

- **The shortcuts for commands in the nono editor are as follows:**  

| shortcuts | function                                                  |
| -------- |-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ctrl+g | Show Help                                                 |
| ctrl+x | nano exit (or close the current file buffer)              |
| ctrl+o | Save the file you are currently editing                   |
| ctrl+j | Put the ends of the paragraphs side by side               |
| ctrl+r | Add the contents of another file to the current file.     |
| ctrl+k | Delete and copy the current line or selected text         |
| ctrl+u | Paste                                                     |

Select one of the validator key files on your My Computer and read it to the text editor.   
And copy and paste the content into AWS' terminal.   
The validator key file on my computer looks like this: # is any number.  

```text
keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-##########.json
```

Now `root/mykeys/key1.json` has copied the contents of the validator key file that you generated on my computer.  
Press ctrl+o to save. The file name will then show you and ask if you want to save or cancel. Press Enter to save.   
Then press ctrl+x to exit the editor.  

#### 8.2.2. Importing validator key

The command below imports all validator keys inside the folder `root/mykeys` into the wallet.

```shell
./agora.sh validator accounts import mykeys
```

If it is printed on the same day as above, it means that the validator key cannot be imported because the password is entered incorrectly.   

The import is now complete.  

#### 8.2.3. To print a list of imported validator keys

Verify that the validation key has been successfully imported and to verify again, run the following command  

```shell
./agora.sh validator accounts list
```

The following is displayed. Enter accept in this course. You must enter the password for 'wallet'.  
This will output the public keys of the imported validator.

```

### 8.3. Creating text with the wallet's password written on it

The validator program must read the validator key in 'wallet' for it to run.  
However, only the user knows the password for 'wallet', and the program does not know it, so program ask it every time it runs.  
This is good for security, but it is difficult to solve for running a program in the background.   
Therefore, you should record the password in text and inform the validator program.   

Use the following command to enter a password for automatic and background execution.   
The default value is 'password'. Please change this to the password of the wallet.  

```shell
nano root/config/cl/password.txt
```
The commands in the nano editor are the same as before.  
Save : ctrl+o and Enter  
Exit : ctrl+x  

### 8.4. Registering a fee deposit account

From February 9, 2023, the validator's ability to propose blocks will be added.  
The BOSagora network pays the validator a transaction fee included in the validator's proposed block.  
In order to receive this compensation, you need to register your account.  
The information in the account can be set differently for each validator. For convenience, we will set the payment to one address.  

[Reference](https://agora-cl-docs.bosagora.org/docs/execution-node/fee-recipient)

Run the following command to modify the fee deposit account. 

```shell
nano root/config/cl/proposer_config.json
```

Then you can check that the following contents already exist.  

```json
{
  "proposer_config": {
    "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000": {   
      "fee_recipient": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    }
  },
  "default_config": {
    "fee_recipient": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  }
}
```

You can modify it as below. For `fee_recipient`, enter the user's metamask address.  

```json
{
  "proposer_config": {
  },
  "default_config": {
    "fee_recipient": "0xD85864db188F0425556139872c764c4Ee64dE3B3"
  }
}
```
The commands in the nano editor are the same as before.  
Save : ctrl+o and Enter  
Exit : ctrl+x

### 8.5. Running the validator client

When 'agora-el-node' and 'agora-cl-node' are running, run the following command to run the validator client.  

```shell
./agora.sh validator run
```

The following log is then output. 

```log
[2023-01-18 07:01:51]  WARN flags: Running Agora-cl (Agora Consensus Layer) client using chain configuration yaml file

```
After 12 hours of depositing 40,000 BOA, validators are activated and act as validator.  
If the validator client does not start within 12 hours of deposit, the BOA's balance will be reduced due to a penalty.   
Therefore, please have sufficient knowledge of node installation and operation before depositing 40,000 BOA.   

## 9. To run in the background using 'docker-compose'

The 'agora-el-node', 'agora-cl-node', and 'agora-cl-validator' that have been started so far will also terminate the process when the connection to the server is stopped.  
Therefore, you must ensure that these processes run in the background.  
An easy way to do this is to use 'docker-compose'.  

First, you check if synchronization of historical block data of 'agora-el-node', 'agora-cl-node' is completed.  
When all blocks are synchronized, you press ctrl+c to end the process in this order: 'agora-cl-validator', 'agora-cl-node', and 'agora-el-node'.  

The command below runs three processes in the background.  

```shell
./agora.sh docker-compose up                                                                                         
```

The following log is then output.  

```log
Creating network "agora-chain-mainnet_default" with the default driver
Creating agora-el-node ... done
Creating agora-cl-node ... done
Creating agora-cl-validator ... done
```

The command to terminate the process is as follows.

```shell
./agora.sh docker-compose down
```

To view the execution status of the nodes, check the log using the docker command.  

You can check the log of 'agora-el-node' by executing the command below. Enter ctrl+c to exit.  

```shell
docker logs -f agora-el-node
```

You can check the log of 'agora-cl-node' by executing the command below. Enter ctrl+c to exit.  

```shell
docker logs -f agora-cl-node
```

You can check the log of 'agora-cl-validator' by executing the command below. Enter ctrl+c to exit. 

```shell
docker logs -f agora-cl-validator
```
